# MIT 6.046: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## Descriptions

- Offered by: MIT
- Prerequisites: Introductory level courses of Algorithms (6.006/CS61B/CS106B/CS106X or equivalent)
- Programming Languages: Python
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 100 hours+

Part 2 of the MIT Algorithms Trilogy. Taught by Erik Demaine, Srini Devadas, and Nancy Lynch.

Compared with 6.006 where you just learn and use the algorithms directly, in 6.046 you will be required to learn a methodology to "Design and analyze" algorithms to solve certain problems. There are few programming exercises in this course, and most of the assignmnets are about proposing an algorithm and do some mathematical proofs. Therefore, it would be much harder than 6.006.

Part 3 of the MIT Algorithms Trilogy is 6.854 Advanced Algorithms. But for the most of the exercises you'll encounter in tests and job-hunting, 6.046 is definitely enough.
