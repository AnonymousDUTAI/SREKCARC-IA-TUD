CS106B/X are advanced programming courses at Stanford. CS106X is more difficult and in-depth than CS106B, but the main content is similar. Based on programming assignments in C++ language, students will develop the ability to solve real-world problems through programming abstraction. It also covers some simple data structures and algorithms, but is generally not as systematic as a specialized data structures course.
