When it comes to Andrew Ng, no one in the AI community should be unaware of him. He is one of the founders of the famous online education platform [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), and also a famous professor at Stanford. This introductory machine learning course must be one of his famous works (the other is his deep learning course), and has hundreds of thousands of learners on Coursera (note that these are people who paid for the certificate, which costs several hundred dollars), and the number of nonpaying learners should be far more than that.

The class is extremely friendly to novices, and Andrew has the ability to make machine learning as straightforward as 1+1=2. You'll learn about linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and recommender systems, etc. and solidify your understanding with hands-on programming. The quality of the assignments needs no word to say. With detailed code frameworks and practical background, you can use what you've learned to solve real problems.

Of course, as a public mooc, the difficulty of this course has been deliberately lowered, and many mathematical derivations are skimmed over. If you are interested in machine learning theory and want to investigate the mathematical theory behind these algorithms, you can refer to [CS229](./CS229.md) and [CS189](./CS189.md).

## Personal Resources

My implementation is lost in system reinstallation. However, the course is so famous that you can easily find related resources online. Also, course material is available on Coursera.
