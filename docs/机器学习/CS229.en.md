This is another ML course offered by Andrew Ng. Since it is graduate-level, it focuses more on the mathematical theory behind machine learning. If you are not satisfied with using off-the-shelf tools but want to understand the essence of the algorithm, or aspire to engage in theoretical research on machine learning, you can take this course. All the lecture notes are provided on the course website, written in a professional and theoretical way, requiring a solid mathematical background.
