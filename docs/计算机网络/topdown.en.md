*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* is a classic textbook in the field of computer networking. The two authors, Jim Kurose and Keith Ross, have carefully crafted a course website to support the textbook, with lecture recordings, interactive online questions, and WireShark labs for network packet analysis. The only pity is that this course doesn't have hardcore programming assignments, and Stanford's [CS144](./CS144.en.md) makes up for that.
